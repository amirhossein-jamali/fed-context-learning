# FedContext-Learning

A context-aware federated learning framework with domain generalization capabilities, designed to evolve into an LLM-powered distributed learning system.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project aims to build a federated learning system that can:
1. Learn from multiple domains while preserving privacy
2. Adapt to new domains through context-aware aggregation
3. Leverage large language models for knowledge distillation
4. Maintain lightweight clients while benefiting from server-side knowledge

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic FL with CNN
- [x] Implement basic federated learning with CNN
- [x] Support for PACS dataset
- [x] FedAvg aggregation

### Phase 2: Unsupervised Domain Embedding
- [ ] Extract domain-specific features
- [ ] Implement unsupervised domain embedding
- [ ] Add domain similarity metrics

### Phase 3: Adaptive Aggregation
- [ ] Implement attention-based aggregation
- [ ] Add domain-aware weighting
- [ ] Improve generalization to unseen domains

### Phase 4: Knowledge Distillation
- [ ] Integrate LLM for server-side knowledge
- [ ] Implement teacher-student learning
- [ ] Add knowledge transfer mechanisms

### Phase 5: LLM-Powered Learning
- [ ] Add lightweight LLM support for clients
- [ ] Implement prompt-based learning
- [ ] Add cross-modal knowledge transfer
